          <h2>Fall20 ITS Project: StonyScape</h2>
          <h4 style="margin-left: 10%;">
            For many college freshman, the idea of moving into a dorm, getting involved, and making new friends are all challenges on their own, but to do so all at once may seem very daunting.
            <br>All of this along with a pandemic can be very stressful for college freshman in an already stressful time of their lives. Our goal is to create a service that will make this process much smoother for these students. We hope to provide another option for students to expand their horizons and make it easier for them to adjust to the different challenges they face when starting their college life.

In SharkSweeper, the players have to clear grid and find the treasure without detonating any of the hidden mines(shark). There is hint as numbers when you click on the blank spot; for example, if it shows 2, that means there are 2 sharks around the 8 neighboring boxes. In order to raise the flag on the suspected mines, the player can press up/down key while clicking on the suspected position.
              <br>In addition to that, there is helper called lighting pearl that can light up 4 boxes around the surrounding(up, down, left & right) if you click on it. If there is shark(s) around the pearl, they will go away(revealed shark picture in the game w/o losing.<br>
