          <p>Hello, this is Choi Ying Yau!<br>I'm born in Hong Kong on 12/26/2002. My family and I immigrated to the United States in 2015. Though have gone through some hardships of getting used to new homeplace and language, I have learned a lot from my schools and obtained many unforgettable memories with my friends since 8th grade.
            <br>I have just graduated from James Madison High School on June 2020. And currently I'm a CS major student at Stony Brook College. I got to know about Computer Science when I was in 10th grade taking Visual Basics, and later developed more interests in it when I took AP CS A as a 11th grader.
