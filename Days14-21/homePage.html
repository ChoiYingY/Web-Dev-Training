            I came from Hong Kong and it is a beautiful place. I have grown up and lived in a governmental building in Yau Tong(most middle-class people live in governmental buidling in Hong Kong because it is a populated city that is lack of lands, so it is impossible to own a single house like the US does here). Despite of that, it was a comfortable living place with many neighbors on a single floor(I lived on 16th floor). In addition to that, there was 3 shopping center around the building I lived, and there is a train station right beneath it. It was really convenient to go around back then, which I can never experiece once again in New York. Sometimes I misses my home, but I can no longer live there.

                This is how it looks from outside of the ground floor of the building I lived in. I remember there is always a tall tree when I opened the front door and left the building.

                This is the mini-park that is right outside of the back door of the building. I used to have a great time playing with my siblings there even it's just a small park.

There is also a Secondary School named St. Antonius Girls' College(SAGC) for girls that is a few streets away.</p>

We also ate hotpot and decorated classroom at school as class activity. I always really cherish the memories.</p>

              Middle School(8th grade: 2015 ~ 2016 summer): Intermediate School 96(IS 96 Seth Low). I already learned basic English in Hong Kong, so communication was not a problem and the school decide to put me in a regular class where there is no beginner/intermediate ESL students here. But the way I spoke English was pretty awkward when I first came here. Luckily, the people were nice and had high acceptance. So I gradually became open to my classmates.

              <p style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: 2% 0;">It is such a regret not to taking photos with them and teachers before COVID happened. JMHS figured a way to celebrate graduates in 2020, where they put all of the graduation photos in front of the school gates. That's pretty creative to be honest.

            I'm currently studying Computer Science at Stony Brook right now! There isn't too much content of it because we are having online class & my college life has just started, but I'm excited of it!
            <br>During the summer, I have joined a merit program for females in CS, which we had a group project of making(see more details on 'My Project' page), and I have made lots of friends there! This winter, we are going to have a group project of making a website using HTML, CSS & Python Flask. And the current plan of my group is to make a shopping website(for clothes). So look forward to it!
            <br>During fall, the clubs that I've joined includes: Women In Computer Science(WICS) and Japanese Student Organization. Many people I already know are there and I had a great time whenever I joined the meeting, especially with game nights.s
