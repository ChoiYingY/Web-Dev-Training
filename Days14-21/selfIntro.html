					<h3>Favorite Music</h3>
					<p class="description">
						My favorite music of all time is 'Iris', a instrumental BGM that comes from LaTale, which is a RPG(Role-playing game) that I've always played since childhood(even now, I still play the game sometimes).
						<br>This is a music for a character named Iris, who is strongest explorer in the game but unfortunately did not survived after fighting against the demon king. To me, this music really illustrates the feeling of her journey well. The music at the beginning gives a sense of loneliness and dazed, but as she gets to meet more friends in journey, the music gets more delightful. And as you can hear, there is echo before music ends. I think that just sounds like that she has left the world lightly.
