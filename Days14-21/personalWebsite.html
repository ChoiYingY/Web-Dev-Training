          <p>Hello, this is Choi Ying Yau!<br>I'm born in Hong Kong on 12/26/2002. My family and I immigrated to the United States in 2015. Though have gone through some hardships of getting used to new homeplace and language, I have learned a lot from my schools and obtained many unforgettable memories with my friends since 8th grade.
            <br>I have just graduated from James Madison High School on June 2020. And currently I'm a CS major student at Stony Brook College. I got to know about Computer Science when I was in 10th grade taking Visual Basics, and later developed more interests in it when I took AP CS A as a 11th grader.

          <h3>Favorite Music</h3>
          <p class="description">My favorite music of all time is 'Iris', a instrumental BGM that comes from LaTale, which is a RPG(Role-playing game) that I've always played since childhood(even now, I still play the game sometimes).
            <br>This is a music for a character named Iris, who is strongest explorer in the game but unfortunately did not survived after fighting against the demon king. To me, this music really illustrates the feeling of her journey well. The music at the beginning gives a sense of loneliness and dazed, but as she gets to meet more friends in journey, the music gets more delightful. And at last, she left the world lightly(there is echo before music ends).</p>
