          <h2>Favorite Manga</h2>
          <p class="description">
            My favorite manga has been One Piece. It was during my 4th grade when I watched the anime of One Piece on TV. It is fun to watch the adventure of the main character Luffy and his crewmates together. One Piece can be very entertaining but some scenes are touching as well. In conclusion, what I like about One piece the most is the relationship of friends and family because it is heartwarming. 01/03/2021 is the day when One Piece release the 1000th chapter of the manga. I still can't believe that I have been loving the manga for so long time.

          <h2>Favorite Music</h2>
          <p class="description">
            My favorite music of all time is 'Iris', a instrumental BGM that comes from LaTale, which is a RPG(Role-playing game) that I've always played since childhood(even now, I still play the game sometimes).
            <br>This is a music for a character named Iris, who is strongest explorer in the game. To me, this music depicts the feeling of her journey well. The music at the beginning gives a sense of loneliness & puzzled, but as she gets to meet more friends in journey, the music gets more delightful. Before the music ends, there is echo, which make me feels like she has left the world lightly at last because unfortunately, Iris did not survived after fighting against the demon king.
